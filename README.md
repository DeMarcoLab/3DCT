# README #

This Toolbox is build for 3D correlative microscopy. It helps with 3D to 2D correlation of three dimensional confocal image stacks to two dimensional SEM/FIB dual beam microscope images. Though it is not limited to that.

The Toolbox comes with a PyQt4 GUI. Further dependencies as of now are:

* PyQt4
+ numpy
+ scipy
+ matplotlib
+ cv2 (opencv)
+ tifffile (Christoph Gohlke)

A test dataset can be downloaded from the "tesdata" folder.

### Version ###

Version 2.0 receives a revised GUI and image stack handling (reslicing) done in python (formerly outsourced to FIJI)
